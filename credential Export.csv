In various domains including K-12, higher education, and workforce development, these teams are tasked with creating engaging and immersive virtual learning experiences that can substitute for on-ground instruction. 
This master's program was built from the ground up to help those involved in learning experience design gain an updated skill set, preparing them to meet the unique needs of each student within today's new learning environment. The program incorporates design thinking, learning analytics, and universal design and accessibility. 
The Master of Science in Learning Experience Design and Educational Technology is offered in two tracks: the K-12 Learning Designer pathway and the Adult Learning Designer pathway. These tracks allow students to specify if they are hoping to implement their knowledge in an academic or educational setting, or in a corporate setting.

In various domains including K-12, higher education, and workforce development, these teams are tasked with creating engaging and immersive virtual learning experiences that can substitute for on-ground instruction. 
This master's program was built from the ground up to help those involved in learning experience design gain an updated skill set, preparing them to meet the unique needs of each student within today's new learning environment. The program incorporates design thinking, learning analytics, and universal design and accessibility. 
The Master of Science in Learning Experience Design and Educational Technology is offered in two tracks: the K-12 Learning Designer pathway and the Adult Learning Designer pathway. These tracks allow students to specify if they are hoping to implement their knowledge in an academic or educational setting, or in a corporate setting.
